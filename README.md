# Ionized
A Balatro example mod for adding a custom Edition in Steamodded.

Feel free to copy and use this for any of projects!

## Notes incase you can't read
**If you want an Edition to have more than one of the following:**
- mult
- chips
- x_mult

Then you will have to write the code for it yourself!

**Also as of right now, editions do NOT work with:**
- h_mult (Mult for holding in hand)
- h_x_mult (X Mult for holding in hand)

Again, you'd have to write it yourself.

## Working with Shaders
I have also detailed a bit on how to work with shaders within the ionized.fs comments.
Read it for some information, but if you need more take a look through the decompiled balatro source
All shaders for cards are in resources/shaders

## Current Bugs
- The description of cards doesn't display properly
